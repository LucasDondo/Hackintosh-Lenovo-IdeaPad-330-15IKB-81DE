# üòú Everything (everything!? Well, no.) you need to know is right here!
However, I strongly suggest using this EFI folder as a mere guide, and not as an _easy-peasy-and-already-made-with-a-lot-of-love_ installation medium. No one should rely on this files. What I do suggest is to follow the [official OpenCore guides](https://dortania.github.io/getting-started/), and maybe then use this EFI folder as a guide for troubleshooting, but you need to **understand what you are doing**.
Everyone tells you to understand what you are doing when dealing with this kind of software, but many times we just go for it without thinking much. From my personal experience, there is no way to be successful in creating a hackintosh if you don't understand the values, files and problems you are dealing with.

Now, a bit of positivity: I got most stuff to work and, for my use case, this is a quite reliable machine with the awesome mac operating system! It is a nice experience and you deserve it, so go for it! And, if you find a way to make this EFI even better, just [create an issue](https://github.com/LucasDondo/Hackintosh-Lenovo-IdeaPad-330-15IKB-81DE/issues/new/choose) or [open a pull request](https://github.com/LucasDondo/Hackintosh-Lenovo-IdeaPad-330-15IKB-81DE/compare), whatever suits the best!

# üíªÔ∏è Hardware specifications

**Laptop**: Lenovo IdeaPad 330-15IKB 81DE

**CPU**: Intel(R) Core(TM) i3-8130U CPU @ 2.20GHz (Kaby Lake Refresh)

**GPU**: Intel Corporation UHD Graphics 620

**HDD**: Seagate ST1000LM035-1RK1

- **Version**: LCM2

- **Serial**: WKP0ZZA9

**Ethernet chipset**: Realtek Semiconductor Co., Ltd. RTL8111/8168/8411 PCI Express Gigabit Ethernet Controller

**WLAN/Bluetooth chipset**: Intel Corporation Dual Band Wireless-AC 3165 Plus Bluetooth

**Motherboard**: Lenovo LNVNB161216

**Audio codec**: ALC3240, also known as ALC230, as mentioned [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/hackintosh/comments/hzjb44/codec_finder/).

**Touchpad**:

- **Vendor**: 044e (according to `nano /proc/bus/input/devices`), so it is of type [ALPS](https://devicehunt.com/view/type/usb/vendor/044E).

- **Type**: USB, I2C (yeah, at the end it is both ALPS and I2C)

- **Model**: AUI1667:00 044E:121E

**Keyboard**: From the Linux command line instructions, it seemed to be the same as the touchpad (I2C), but [AIDA64](https://www.aida64.com/) told me it is **PS/2**, not I2C. That's why it works with VoodooPS2Controller.kext.

# ‚òπÔ∏è Problems, and solutions! üôÇ

## üñ•Ô∏è GPU and display

For DRM, we don't have support (check [this](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/drm.html#fixing-drm)) to use with hardware, so for Netflix we need to use Google Chrome, which uses software-powered DRM.

When rebooting or waking the laptop while connected to an HDMI screen, we need to re-plug the HDMI cable or turn the external monitor off and on again. If you happen to find a solution, please create a pull request.

Do not use 00001B59 as AAPL,ig-platform-id since with that not even keyboard or mouse work.

To solve the pink screen on HDMI devices, set this ([this](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/gpu-patching/intel-patching/connector.html) is the guide I followed):

## üåê Networks

[Here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/ktext.html#ethernet) it says that by using RealtekRTL8111 v2.3.0 the kext may not work and even though I installed v2.4.0, it did not work. v2.2.2 did the work.

WiFi will just work with [itlwm](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm) (and [SecureBootModel](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/config-laptop.plist/kaby-lake.html#misc) has to be in _Default_, because using _Disabled_ [this](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/itlwm/issues/301) happens). Bluetooth does not work with [this](https://github.com/OpenIntelWireless/IntelBluetoothFirmware) kext, but it does need IntelBluetoothInjector (same link as before) to turn it on and off.

## üí§ Sleep

If when it goes to sleep, it continuously goes like... Partial wake, sleep, partial wake, sleep, and so on, do [this](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/misc/instant-wake.html). That partial wake is called **darkwake**.

Another issue with sleep is that it requires two keypresses to wake completely. To solve this, I followed [this](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/misc/keyboard.html) guide. The [third method](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/usb/misc/keyboard.html#method-3-configuring-darkwake) worked, using `darkwake=0`.

## üñ±Ô∏è Trackpad

There is no way to make it work since it is both I2C and ALPS. See [the issue I created in GitHub](https://github.com/VoodooI2C/VoodooI2C/issues/358#event-3638746641).

Since there is no way to make it work, we won't use SSDT-GPI0.aml (it's useless in our case).

**Edit**: see [here](https://github.com/VoodooI2C/VoodooI2C/issues/358#issuecomment-939154909) what someone suggested. It may work, but I can't tell first-hand.

# üìù Notes

**Guide followed**: [Dortania's OpenCore](http://dortania.github.io).

I disabled SIP as said [here](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/troubleshooting/extended/post-issues.html#disabling-sip).

## <a id="multibootingGuide">üçé Multibooting guide üêß ü™ü</a>

> ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Note that this worked for me, that I had already installed both Linux and Windows 10 in my machine. Linux boots into Grub Rescue, but I believe this is because of a error I made during my first time trying to install macOS.

1. [Install macOS](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/).
2. Mount your internal drive and bootable USB drive's EFI partitions.
3. [Set up LauncherOption](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/multiboot/bootstrap.html) in your USB drive (this has already be done for you in this EFI).
4. From the internal drive's EFI, move everything to your desktop (even better if you back it up in a safer place, such as a server or external drive).
5. Move everything from the USB to the drive's EFI.
6. Disconnect the USB and reboot.
7. Move back from your desktop the folder used to boot other OSs (for example *Microsoft* or *ubuntu*).
8. You can now, happily, boot into other OSs as well as on your brand new macOS.

## ‚¨ÜÔ∏è Updating OpenCore guide

> üôèüèº Please do read [OpenCore's official guide on updating OpenCore](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Post-Install/universal/update.html) as a first step. Please.

1. Download this repository's latest release (or do it manually with the official guide linked above).
2. Make your necessary changes, if needed.
3. Copy the EFI folder downloaded to your [bootable USB drive](https://dortania.github.io/OpenCore-Install-Guide/installer-guide/)'s EFI.
4. Reboot into your USB drive and test that everything works fine enough.
5. Repeat the [previous guide](#multibootingGuide) from step number 4 (even if you are not multibooting. In that case you will just skip step number 7).
